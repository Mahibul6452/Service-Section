                            processing

                            merchants of all types and those that are considered hard-to place</p>

                        <h2>Medium-High Risk Credit Card Processing</h2>
                        <p>A surcharge, otherwise known as a ‘checkout fee,’ is a fee imposed upon the consumer during a
                            credit card transaction that covers the cost to accept the payment method. The POS system or
                            terminal automatically detects when a consumer is paying with a credit card, and imposes the
                            surcharge on that transaction type only. Before the transaction goes through, the POS system
                            or
                            terminal offers alternative payment options such as debit card, check, and cash if the
                            consumer
                            would prefer to avoid a surcharged transaction.</p>

                        <h2>Nutraceutical Payment Processing</h2>
                        <p>Consumers are purchasing nutraceuticals at increasing numbers year over year, and more
                            individuals are meeting the demand for this market through e-commerce sites. Business is
                            growing, but credit card processing is slow to fully support this thriving industry. (Site

                            businesses – typically classified as high-risk. Learn more about our high-risk merchant

                            exposes your business to significant risks. Flat rate pricing from big-box processors may
                            seem appealing, but will often cause you to overpay to accept electronic payments and settle
                            for inadequate service and support. We’re a subscription box processor. Our expertise is
                            your success! We treat each subscription business uniquely, providing complimentary
                            statement analysis and custom pricing to meet their needs.</p>

                            tourism industry can be difficult. Additionally, the credit card processing industry
                            generally categorizes all travel entities as “high risk” due to a number of factors that are
                            beyond the control of these businesses. Unfortunately, this can mean higher processing rates
                            and less support.</p>

                        <h2>Credit Repair Account Solutions</h2>
                        <p>Credit repair businesses may find it difficult to secure electronic payment processing
                            services due to the current regulatory landscape and its direct impact on the industry.
                            Statutes like the Credit Repair Organizations Act, as well as others, often prohibit and
                            restrict certain business models, and penalize merchants for non-compliance. Regulatory and
                            compliance issues are only a few reasons why credit repair businesses should seek a merchant
                            services provider with extensive industry expertise. With the right merchant services
                            pricing and solutions, credit repair businesses can experience growth and longevity in their
                            highly regulated industries. We have the best interest of your high-risk business in mind.

                            The current regulatory climate places restrictions on businesses operating in the debt
                            collection ecosystem. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, for instance, prevents
                            collection agencies from abusive practices and limits communication, legal action and
                            disclosures. Regulatory requirements and compliance concerns often prevent acquiring banks
                            from approving merchant accounts for collection agencies. Debt collection businesses should
                            partner with a merchant service provider that has expertise in high-risk merchant processing
                            as well as the collections industry, in order to support compliance and best practices
